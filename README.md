- docker (must be installed)
- apache (is not required... docker buils it)
- the conf file is not used (old idea)
- restart.sh 
-- has all the commands to start and stop the container; 
-- careful as it stops and removes ANY docker container running.

## Instructions

Clone this repo
```
. ./restart.sh
```
Access at localhost:8080
